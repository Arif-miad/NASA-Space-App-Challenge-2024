### Introduction:
The ExoFun app is designed to help people learn about planets outside our solar system. Users can learn about exoplanets through storytelling and interactive features.
### Startup:
On startup, users will be greeted with welcome screen where they can input their names and create profile or continue to the main app.

## App Sections
The app is divided in 5 primary sections. Along with one Introductory section, we have 4 Planet sections, each for every exoplanet type.
## Exoplanet
A brief about exoplanets and their types, the history and some NASA data to get the basic idea.
## Super Earth
### 5 Levels about Super Earths
### 1. Introduction
What is Super Earth and many topics and facts including the methods to detect these planets.
### 2. Proxima Centauri B
Info about a super earth exoplanet named Proxima Centauri B with stories, comparisons to Earth and many other facts.
### 3. Keplar 452b
Info about another super earth exoplanet named Keplar 452b with content similar to the previous one.
### 4. Make A Planet Game 
A game where users have to build a planet using many variables with the goal being creating a Super Earth. This will test their knowledge about Super Earths from the previous sections.
### 5. Quiz
Finally a quiz on all 4 levels of the Super Earth section.
## Terrestrials, Gas Giants and Neptune 
### 5 similar Levels about each of them in their respective sections.
These sections are not included as of now. We plan on developing them in the future.


# Educational Goals
## This project makes learning about exoplanets easier and more enjoyable, helping to answer questions and spark their curiosity about space. 

# Accessibilty
## Outside the app, we have created a book with similar contents to make it accessible to those from underserved communities or with limited access to resources. So they can learn about exoplanets even without access to mobile phones and internet.
